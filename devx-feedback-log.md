DevX Feedback Log
============================

Please log any blocking or challenging issues that you encounter while writing the sample code.
This feedback will be shared with the BU to help improve items like: Setup Guides and Information, Sandbox experience and use, API stability, API Design, API Docs etc.

More information is better... so feel free to log anything that you think might be useful.

More detail is better... be detailed in the way that record the information, include relevant links, versions, screenshots, etc. and be descriptive  when you explain what you encountered.

You can even record a screencast video to demonstrate your issue.

Here is an example:
