sample-code-template-project
============================

Start Here: This is the template for starting a sample code project for DevNet.

You can use this template to start a new sample code project.

***Question For Team*****
 Should we have 1 repo per technology (example: cmx repo that contains all cmx related sample apps) or one repo per sample project?

These are the tools and workflow to use for Sample Code work:

**Request a New Sample Code Example**

* Use the Issue list in for the DevNet-Sample-Code Organization: http://cto-github.cisco.com/DevNet-Sample-Code/sample-code-template-project/issues?labels=New+Sample+Request&state=open
* Label the Issue with "New Sample Request
    
**Submit a Bug for Sample Code**

* Create an Issue in the project for the code, label it as a bug
    
**Request and enhancement to existing sample code**

* Create an Issue in the project for the code, label it as an enhancement
    
**Store all code in this GitHub Organization**

* Create a repo for each new technology based on this template
    
**When code is finished**

* it will be reviewed and promoted to the external Cisco DevNet area on public GitHub
