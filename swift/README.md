# Swift

The Flare.xcworkspace contains several projects:

- SocketIO: a framework for connecting to Socket.IO servers
- Flare: a framework for connecting to the Flare server
- Explorer: a Mac app for browsing and editing Flare objects
- Trialteral: an iOS app that displays a map of the environment
- ReflektorRemote: a small app that synchronizes data with a thing
- Importer: a simple app for importing data into the server

## Requirements

The Swift sample code is designed to work with Xcode 7.1, Swift 2.1, iOS 9.1 and OS X 10.11. 

## Setup

To get started, open the Flare.xcworkspace to view all the projects in one window. 

The SocketIO framework is written in Swift and works on OS X, iOS and watchOS. 

The Flare framework is written in Swift, and works on OS X, iOS and watchOS. Beacon localization services depend on Bluetooth hardware and work only on iOS. The Swift framework depends on the SocketIO framework. 

## Mac

The [Explorer app](explorermac.html) runs on OS X and provides an overview of all environments, zones, things and devices in the database. It depends on both the SocketIO and the Flare frameworks. 

To build for Mac, first build the SocketIO framework, then build the Flare framework, then build the Explorer app. When building the frameworks, make sure to choose Edit Scheme and change the build configuration from Debug to Release. The built frameworks will be placed in the Output/Release/ folder inside the folder for each project, where other projects link to them. 

By default, the app connects to the server on localhost at port 1234. You can specify another server or port in the Preferences. 

## iOS

To build for iOS, first build the SocketIO framework, then the Flare framework, then the [Trilateral app](trilateral-ios.md). 

The iOS frameworks have an aggregate target with a build script that can produce a framework for both devices and the iOS Simulator. When building the frameworks for iOS, make sure to select the "Universal" target. Further, make sure to choose Edit Scheme and change the build configuration from Debug to Release. 

Once you have done so, the build script will produce a universal framework. The built frameworks will be placed in the Output/Release-iphoneuniversal/ folder inside the folder for each project, where other projects link to them. You can verify that the framework has architectures for both the simulator (i386 and x86_64) and devices (armv7 and arm64) with this file command:

```all
$ cd /path/to/Flare 
$ cd Output/Release-iphoneuniversal/Flare.framework/
$ file Flare
Flare: Mach-O universal binary with 4 architectures
Flare (for architecture i386):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
Flare (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64
Flare (for architecture armv7):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library arm
Flare (for architecture arm64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library
```

By default, the app connects to the server on localhost at port 1234. That works fine in the simulator, but on a device you'll need to specify the server and port in the Settings app.

## Framework documentation 

The Flare framework contains several classes:

FlareManager is a high level class with methods for calling both the Flare REST API (for describing objects in the environment) and the Flare Socket.IO API (for realtime communication between objects). See the [Flare API](api.html#swift) page for complete documentation.

FlareModel.swift contains definitions of the Environment, Zone, Thing and Device classes, which all inherit common variables and methods from the abstract Flare superclass. These objects can be initialized with JSON objects returned by the FlareManager. 

```swift
public typealias JSONDictionary = [String:AnyObject]
public typealias JSONArray = [JSONDictionary]

public func sendRequest(uri: String,
    params: JSONDictionary?,
    method: HTTPMethod,
    message: JSONDictionary?,
    handler:(AnyObject) -> ())
public func sendRequest(uri: String, 
	params: JSONDictionary?, 
	handler:(AnyObject) -> ())
public func sendRequest(uri: String, 
	handler:(AnyObject) -> ())
```
APIManager is a class for calling a generic REST API. It defines a JSONDictionary typealias to refer to a dictionary with String keys, and a JSONArray object as an array of JSONDIctionary objects. The APIManager's main method is sendRequest(), which has several variants with different number of arguments. It makes HTTP requests asynchronously, and calls the handler closure when the response is available. The handler closure takes a JSONDictionary containing the response, or a JSONArray for methods that returns a list of objects.

```swift
flareManager.getEnvironment("123") {json in 
	let environment = Environment(json)
}

flareManager.listZones("123") {jsonArray in 
	for json in jsonArray {
		let zone = Zone(json)
	}
}
```
For example, to send a request like GET /environments/123, here's an example in Swift that creates an Environment object. Note that when calling a method in Swift where the last argument is a closure, you can specify the closure _outside_ the parentheses, and the argument types can be inferred. 

BeaconManager is a class allows an iOS device to calculate its position in the environment based on the distance to three or more iBeacons. 

Extensions.swift contains a number of useful extensions, which allow you to do things like subtract one CGPoint from another to find the diagonal distance. Swift is a highly extensible language, and many operators are overridden on particular pairs of types. 

## Using FlareManager

You can use the FlareManager to calling both the Flare REST API (for describing objects in the environment) and the Flare Socket.IO API (for realtime communication between objects). 

### Init
```swift
var flareManager = FlareManager(host, port)
```
Provide the host and port when initializing the FlareManager.
	
### Set delegate
```swift
flareManager.delegate = self
```
Set the delegate to receive SocketIO message callbacks.

### Connect
```swift
flareManager.connect()
```
Connect to the server before calling the SocketIO interface.
	
### REST interface
```swift
flareManager.getEnvironments() {jsonArray in 
	for json in jsonArray {
		let environment = Environment(json)
	}
}

flareManager.getEnvironment("123") {json in 
	let environment = Environment(json)
}

flareManager.listZones("123") {jsonArray in 
	for json in jsonArray {
		let zone = Zone(json)
	}
}
```
To call a REST method.
	
### Socket.IO interface
```swift
flareManager.getData(environment)
```
To call a SocketIO method.
	
```swift
func didReceiveData(flare: Flare, data: JSONDictionary) {
    NSLog("\(flare.name) data: \(data)")
}
```
Implement a delegate method to receive SocketIO message callbacks.
	
For more examples, see the [Socket.IO tutorial](socketio-tutorial.html?swift).

## Using BeaconManager

You can use the BeaconManager to determine the location of the user's device based on the distances from the beacons in the environment.

```swift
var beaconManager = BeaconManager()
```
Create a BeaconManager:
	
```swift
beaconManager.delegate = self
```
Set the delegate to receive callbacks:

```swift
beaconManager.loadEnvironment(environment)
```
Load the environment into the BeaconManager:

```swift
self.beaconManager.start()
```
Start scanning for beacons:

```swift
func devicePositionDidChange(position: CGPoint) {
    device!.position = position
    flareManager.setPosition(device!, position: position)
}
```
Implement a delegate method to be notified when the device's position changes:


For a complete example, see the [Beacons](beacons.html?swift) tutorial.
