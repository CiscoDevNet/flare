When device data changes:

setData {device:id, key:key, value:value}

When device position changes:

setPosition {device:id, position:{x:x, y:y}}
	 (to other subscribers) position {device:id, position:{x:x, y:y}}


When a device has become near to a thing:

	(to the sender and other subscribers) near {device:id, thing:id, distance:distance}
		GET /things/:id 
		subscribe {thing:id}
